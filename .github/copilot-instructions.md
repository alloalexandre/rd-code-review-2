```

### High-Level Architecture
- Does the change fit the existing module boundaries (UI in `client/` & `imports/ui/`, backend logic & publications/methods in `imports/api/`)?
- Are new concerns introduced in the right layer (avoid putting business rules inside React components or Blaze templates)?
- Is shared logic placed in a reusable util/hook instead of duplicated inline?
- If a new hook was added: is it colocated next to its component unless clearly global (used across multiple unrelated features)?

### Business Logic & Domain Consistency
- Inspect `imports/api/` folder (methods, publications, server hooks) to see if an equivalent capability already exists.
- Reuse existing patterns for: user access control, role checks, collection CRUD helpers, validation.
- Confirm collection schemas or Zod/Yup validators are updated if data shape changed.
- If a new field is added to a collection: was it added to schema, publications, fixtures/seed (if any), validators, and UI forms? Make sure it has a clear label description too.

### Security & Permissions
- Check role/permission gates: uses helpers in `imports/utils/roles.js` or `imports/utils/permissions.js` (avoid ad‚Äëhoc string comparisons).
- **jam:method Security**: Use `jam:method` with `checkRoles` helper for all server methods. Default to `open: false` for protected methods. Validate inputs with Zod.
- **Public Methods**: Only create public methods (`open: true`) in dedicated `publicMethods/` folders when explicitly needed.
- **Role Management**: All new roles must be added to the globals object (`imports/globals/roles.ts`) - every role needs to be properly defined there.
- Publications: restrict fields; never publish secrets (tokens, password hashes, internal flags). Avoid for new features.
- Prevent over-fetching: ensure selectors & `fields` projection minimize attack surface.
- Remove or guard debug logs containing PII.

### Data Validation & Integrity
- Are all mutations validated using shared schemas (`imports/lib/zod.js`, or collection-attached schema)?
- Check for silent failure paths‚Äîprefer throwing with clear error codes/messages.
- Ensure migrations or backfills are considered if schema changes are non-optional.

### Performance Considerations
- Any new publication or query: is there an index supporting its selector? (Add a comment/note if large collection.)
- Avoid N+1 patterns inside methods/publications.
- Large lists: confirm pagination / limit / cursor-based approach.
- Frontend derived computations memoized (React `useMemo`, `useCallback`), especially for table data or expensive filters.

### Tanstack Query Cache & Reactivity
- **Query Keys**: Use descriptive, hierarchical query keys with consistent naming patterns (e.g., `['users', 'list', { filters }]` or `['user', userId]`).
- **Cache Updates After Mutations**: 
  - **Prefer `refetch()`**: Use specific query `refetch()` methods for targeted updates when you know exactly which queries need fresh data
  - **Use `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`**: Only for broader invalidation when multiple related queries need updates
  - **Direct Cache Updates**: Use `queryClient.setQueryData()` for immediate updates when you have the new data structure
- **Optimistic Updates**: Use `useMutation`'s `onMutate` for optimistic updates, with proper rollback in `onError`.
- **Simple Configuration**: Stick with Tanstack Query defaults in most cases. Avoid adding `staleTime` unless you have a specific performance issue or data freshness requirement.
- **Query Dependencies**: Use `enabled` option to prevent unnecessary queries and create proper query dependencies.
- **Infinite Queries**: Use `useInfiniteQuery` for paginated data with proper `getNextPageParam` and `getPreviousPageParam`.
- **Background Refetching**: Configure `refetchOnWindowFocus`, `refetchOnReconnect` based on data sensitivity only when needed.

### Duplication & Reusability
- Search for similar logic before introducing new helpers (look in `imports/api/`, `imports/utils/`, `imports/ui/components/`).
- Abstract repeated validation, constants, and formatting rules into shared utilities.
- Ensure new utility names are descriptive & discoverable.

### Error Handling & Logging
- Consistent error shapes returned (standardized error codes / messages?).
- Avoid swallowing exceptions without logging.
- Use structured logging if present (`_logger.js` patterns) and appropriate log level (info/warn/error).

### Frontend Review
- Semantic HTML5 elements per style guide.
- Accessibility: labels for inputs, alt text for images, keyboard navigation preserved.
- State management: avoid unnecessary re-renders‚Äîcheck dependency arrays & prop drilling. Use Zustand (preferred) or React Context for global state.
- Forms: consistent validation + error surfacing; no duplicate schema definitions.

### Navigation & Routing Setup
- **New Page Creation**: When adding a new page component, ensure proper navigation setup is included:
  - Add route definition to `imports/routes/routePaths.js` with path, breadcrumb, and role permissions
  - Add route to `imports/routes/routes.jsx` within the authenticated routes section
  - **CRITICAL**: Add navigation link to sidebar (for back-office pages using ApplicationLayout):
    - Update `imports/ui/layouts/DefaultLayout/DefaultLayout.jsx` to add the new MenuLink in `topLinks` section
    - OR update `imports/ui/layouts/DefaultLayout/hooks/useAuthorizedLinks.js` for bottom navigation links
    - Include proper role-based access control (`displayTo` prop with appropriate roles)
    - Add descriptive label and appropriate icon name
    - Configure `highlightedByRoutes` for proper active state indication
- **Always ask the user** if they've forgot to precise the navigation setup - this is a common oversight.
- Ensure role-based access is consistent between route permissions (`allow` in routePaths) and navigation visibility (`displayTo` in MenuLink)
- Use `getAllAuthorizedFullPathsForRoute` helper for proper route highlighting in navigation

### Testing
- New logic: unit or integration tests added (services, utils, hooks).
- Critical paths covered with at least 1 happy + 1 failure scenario.
- Avoid brittle tests tied to implementation details.

### Dependency & Package Hygiene
- No unnecessary new dependencies; justify additions in PR description.
- Prefer existing libraries already in `package.json`.
- If removing code that used a dependency, consider whether it can also be removed.

### Documentation & DX
- Update `SETTINGS.md` if new settings keys introduced.
- Update README or inline comments for non-obvious workflows or invariants.
- Add jsdoc / comments for complex algorithms or business rules.

### Security Quick Scan
- No raw user input passed to database selectors without validation/sanitization.
- No credentials/tokens committed.
- Check for potential race conditions in multi-step mutations.

### Migrations / Backwards Compatibility
- If schema changes: Are older clients or existing documents handled gracefully?
- Provide migration script or note if needed.

### PR Hygiene
- Commit messages follow conventional format (commitlint configured).
- PR description: purpose, scope, side effects, testing steps, rollback plan.
- Remove commented-out code & dead files.

## Coding Standards & Best Practices
When writing or reviewing code, adhere to the following standards to ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality across the codebase.

### Code Style
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, main, section, article, etc.)
- Prefer modern JavaScript (ES6+) features like const/let, arrow functions, and template literals

### Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

### Code Quality
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly describe their purpose
- Include helpful comments for complex logic
- Add error handling for user inputs and API calls

### Context Gathering
- Always check [package.json](../package.json) files to understand package versions and dependencies for better context
- Review relevant package.json files in the workspace to understand the technology stack
- Use package versions to ensure compatibility when suggesting solutions or fixes

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract common functionality into reusable functions or utilities
- Use constants for repeated values
- Create shared components for repeated UI patterns
- Avoid code duplication across modules

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each function should have one clear purpose
- Keep components focused on a single concern
- Split large functions into smaller, focused ones
- Separate business logic from UI components

### SOLID Principles
- **Open/Closed**: Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes
- **Interface Segregation**: Don't force classes to depend on unused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Code Organization
- Group related functionality into modules
- Use consistent file and folder structure
- Keep imports organized (external libraries first, then internal modules)
- Limit file length (prefer splitting large files)

### Performance & Maintainability
- Avoid premature optimization, but write efficient code
- Use lazy loading for heavy components
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Write self-documenting code that reduces need for comments
- Keep functions small and testable (ideally under 20 lines)
- For state management, prefer using Zustand over React Context for global state

### Error Handling
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Validate inputs at function boundaries
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

### Testing
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Aim for high test coverage on critical paths
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Keep tests simple and focused on one behavior

## Architecture
Our project follows a modular architecture pattern, separating concerns into distinct layers to enhance maintainability and scalability.

### Directory Responsibilities
Top-level (root):
- `client/` Meteor client entrypoint (`main.jsx`, global styles, static HTML shell). Only UI bootstrapping here; real code lives under `imports/`.
- `server/` Meteor server entrypoint (`main.js`). Only imports startup modules ‚Äì keep it thin.
- `imports/` Core application source organized by concern (API, UI, hooks, lib, globals, startup, utils).
- `packages/` Local Meteor packages (e.g. `meteor-stale-session/`, `suprakit-ui/`). Treat these like external dependencies ‚Äì prefer extending here only when logic is reusable across multiple apps.
- `public/` Static, publicly served assets (imgs, favicons). Never place secrets or build artifacts here.
- `private/` Assets loadable on the server only (e.g. email templates). Not directly web-accessible.
- `i18n/` Translation catalogs. The `standard/` and `supra/` directories layer domain or brand overrides on top of base `en/fr` files.
- `scripts/` One-off or build-time scripts (e.g. `generate-settings-docs.mjs`). These must be idempotent and side‚Äëeffect aware.
- `tests/` App-level integration or high-level tests (Mocha via Meteor test driver). Unit tests colocated near code when meaningful.
- `types/` Ambient TypeScript/JS type declarations (even though we prefer JS runtime code, we allow d.ts for editor help).

Inside `imports/`:
- `imports/api/<domain>/` A domain module: collection definition, methods, publications, and server-only logic.
  - `index.js` (or similarly named) should export the collection & shared constants used by both client & server.
  - `server/` strictly server-side files organized by concern:
    - `schema.js` Collection schema definition (SimpleSchema/Zod)
    - `methods/` Meteor methods organized by functionality
    - `publications.js` Server publications for reactive data
    - `collectionIndexes.js` Database index definitions
    - `queries/` Complex database queries and aggregations
    - `services/` Business logic services
    - `utils/` Domain-specific utility functions
    - `grapherLinks.js` & `grapherReducers.js` GraphQL-related configurations
    - `pipelines/` Data processing pipelines (when applicable)
- `imports/startup/`
  - `both/` Code imported on both client & server early (collection imports, settings load, logger config, schema setup).
  - `client/` Client-only startup (UI theme providers, route mounting, i18n setup, helpscout).
  - `server/` Server-only startup (collection imports, console setup, globals exposure, fake users, roles management, migrations, scheduled jobs, user accounts config).
- `imports/lib/` Cross-cutting library code (accounts helpers, password strength, zod wrapper, security helpers, custom collection wrapper). Must be pure or side-effect light; safe to import anywhere.
- `imports/hooks/` React hooks tied to Meteor (e.g. `useUser`, `useUserId`, `useUserRole`, `useGlobals`, `useTranslator`). New reactive data access patterns belong here rather than inside components.
- `imports/ui/` All React UI organized by type:
  - `components/` Pure/reusable components (GlobalsWrapper, etc.)
  - `layouts/` Layout components (DefaultLayout)
  - `pages/` Route-level page components (LoginPages, SettingsPage, UserInfoPage, UserManagementPage)
  - `modals/` Portal-based interactive surfaces
  - `forms/` Form-specific components
  Keep business logic out ‚Äì delegate to hooks / utils.
- `imports/utils/` Generic, environment-aware helpers (permissions, role management, validated query helpers, integrations, user utilities, password validation). If a util becomes domain-specific, relocate into the domain folder under `imports/api/<domain>/`.
- `imports/globals/` Application-wide constants and configurations:
  - Global constants (emails, httpStatus, languages, roles, publicGlobals)
  - `server/globals/` Server-specific global configurations
- `imports/stores/` Zustand store definitions for client-side state management (example.store.js, i18n.store.js).
- `imports/jobs/` Job definitions for scheduled tasks (exampleJob.js, index.js).
- `imports/migrations/` Database migration scripts.
- `imports/routes/` Routing configuration (routes.jsx, routePaths.js, rerouting.js).

### Layering & Import Rules
1. UI (components/pages) ‚ûú may depend on hooks, utils, lib, globals, domain public exports ‚Äì never directly on `server/` code or raw collections that require server-only concerns.
2. Hooks ‚ûú may depend on lib, utils, globals, and domain public exports (collections) but not on server-only code.
3. Domain server code (`imports/api/**/server/`) ‚ûú may depend on lib, utils. Avoid importing UI or hooks.
4. Startup code ‚ûú may import anything needed to register behavior, but must avoid triggering large UI trees on the server or causing circular domain loading.
5. Local packages (`packages/*`) should not reach back into `imports/` (to keep them portable). Instead, expose needed APIs in the package and have `imports/` consume them.

Enforce direction: `imports/api` (shared parts) is a lower layer than `imports/ui`; circular imports between domain modules are red flags ‚Äì extract shared pieces into `imports/lib/` or `imports/utils/`.

### Collections & Data Flow
- Collections are declared in domain folders using `AHMongoCollection` (our wrapper around `Mongo.Collection`) and imported in startup modules to guarantee initialization order (schemas, helpers, transformers) before any publication/method consumption.
- Always attach schema/validators at declaration time in the domain's `server/schema.js`; do not mutate collection schemas later in ad-hoc files.
- Index definitions belong in the domain `server/collectionIndexes.js` and are imported from startup to run once at startup.
- Publications must explicitly restrict returned fields ‚Äì never return entire documents if not required.
- Collections export only necessary constants & helpers from `imports/api/<domain>/index.js` for client-server shared access.

### Methods & Publications Conventions
- **Methods**: Use `jam:method` package with `checkRoles` helper function for all server methods.
- Method name pattern: `<CollectionName>.methods.<action>` (e.g. `Meteor.users.methods.updateProfile`). Avoid deep dotted namespaces.
- **Default Security**: All methods should have `open: false` by default, meaning users must be logged in to access them.
- **Public Methods**: If a method needs to be publicly accessible, create it in a dedicated `publicMethods/` folder with explicit naming and structure matching the regular `methods/` folder and use 'open: true'.
- **Async Operations**: ALL server operations must be asynchronous (database operations, Roles package calls, etc.). Use `await` consistently.
- **Publications**: Avoid publications for new collections or APIs. Only use them for legacy reasons when absolutely necessary.
- Validate arguments first (Zod/Yup/SimpleSchema or shared validators). Throw early with consistent error codes.
- Authorization second (role/permission helpers with `checkRoles`). Then perform database action.
- Return minimal shape required by caller (avoid leaking entire doc when only ID needed).

### State Management
- Use Zustand for global state management (preferred over React Context for performance).
- Keep component-level state local using React's `useState` and `useReducer`.
- **Tanstack Query for Server State**: Use Tanstack Query for all server-state management - never mix with local state.
- **Query Client Configuration**: Keep QueryClient configuration simple. Use defaults unless you have specific performance requirements.
- **Server State vs Client State**: Clearly separate server state (managed by Tanstack Query) from client state (Zustand/React state).
- Prefer custom hooks for complex state logic that can be reused across components.

### Settings Lifecycle
1. Define schema in `imports/settings/schema.mjs`.
2. Add any new keys to `settings.example.json` and regenerate docs (`scripts/generate-settings-docs.mjs` runs via `predev`).
3. Access settings through a small wrapper (add one if missing) instead of `Meteor.settings` sprinkled everywhere for easier refactors/testing.

### Internationalization
- Base keys live in `i18n/en.i18n.json` & `fr.i18n.json`.
- Layer-specific overrides (e.g. `standard/`, `supra/`) allow brand or product line customizations ‚Äì keys must remain aligned; missing keys fallback to base locale.

### Adding a New Domain Feature (Checklist)
1. Create `imports/api/<NewDomain>/` with collection + schema.
2. Add server-only logic under `imports/api/<NewDomain>/server/` (methods using `jam:method`, avoid publications for new features, indexes).
3. **Methods Setup**: Use `jam:method` with `open: false` by default. Create `publicMethods/` folder only if public access needed.
4. **Async Operations**: Ensure all server operations (database, Roles calls) use `await` and are properly async.
5. Register collection in startup modules.
6. Expose only necessary constants / helpers from `imports/api/<NewDomain>/index.js`.
7. **Query & Mutation Setup**: Create query hooks using Tanstack Query with proper key patterns and cache invalidation strategies.
8. **Mutation Hooks**: Implement mutation hooks with optimistic updates and proper error handling/rollback.
9. Create hooks if UI needs reactive queries rather than placing logic in components.
10. Add UI page/component under `imports/ui/pages/` or `components/`.
11. **Navigation Setup (CRITICAL)**: 
    - Add route definition to `imports/routes/routePaths.js` with proper permissions
    - Add route to `imports/routes/routes.jsx` in authenticated routes
    - **Don't forget**: Add navigation link to `DefaultLayout.jsx` (topLinks) or `useAuthorizedLinks.js` (bottomLinks)
    - Configure role-based visibility and proper icons
    - **Always ask user if navigation setup is complete** - this step is commonly forgotten
12. Add tests: unit (lib/utils), method tests (happy + failure), query/mutation hook tests. Avoid publication tests for new features.
13. **Role Management**: Add any new roles to `imports/globals/roles.ts` and their globals to `imports/globals/server/globals.ts` - all roles must be defined in globals.
14. Add/Update permissions if access model changes.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Importing from `imports/api/**/server/` inside client bundles.
- Embedding validation logic directly inside React components (extract to schema / util / hook).
- Ad-hoc string role checks (`if (user.role === 'admin')`) ‚Äì always use role helpers.
- **Creating methods without `jam:method`** or with `open: true` by default - all methods should be protected unless explicitly public.
- **Using synchronous operations** on the server - all database operations and Roles calls must be async with `await`.
- **Creating new publications** - avoid publications for new features, only use for legacy compatibility.
- **Forgetting to define roles** - all roles must be added to `imports/globals/roles.ts`.
- **Tanstack Query Anti-Patterns**:
  - Using vague or inconsistent query keys (avoid `['data']`, prefer `['users', 'list', { status: 'active' }]`)
  - Over-using `invalidateQueries()` instead of targeted `refetch()` for specific queries
  - Forgetting to update cache after mutations (no refetch, invalidation, or direct cache updates)
  - Not implementing optimistic updates for better UX
  - Mixing server state with local state in components
  - Over-configuring with custom `staleTime`, `gcTime` values without clear performance needs
  - Fetching data in components instead of using proper query hooks
- Over-publishing fields; default to explicit field lists.
- Creating circular startup imports ‚Äì keep startup files declarative, minimal side effects.
- Using React Context for heavy global state (prefer Zustand).

### Execution Sequence (High-Level)
1. Meteor loads `server/main.js` ‚ûú imports startup modules.
2. Collections registered and schemas attached.
3. Indexes + publications + methods registered.
4. Client loads `client/main.jsx` ‚ûú imports client startup modules.
5. UI mounts, hooks begin reactive data subscriptions, methods invoked as needed.

## Project-Specific Business Logic Notes
These rules are specific to our application's domain and should be enforced during code reviews and development.

<!-- Add short bullets capturing business logic so AI reviewers can enforce them. -->
